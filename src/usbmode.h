// USB 2 -> USB 3 mode switch for the RTL8822B (RTL8812BU), as rtw88 does at probe
// (rtw_usb_switch_mode_new; the register sequence as in ref/ac54_sdr/tools/usb3.c). The chip
// enumerates at USB 2 after a cold plug; once switched it re-enumerates as SuperSpeed and stays so
// until it loses power. Register writes only (RAM): nothing is written to efuse or flash.
// If the port or cable has no USB 3 lines the device comes back at USB 2, and the chip records the
// attempt (PAD_CTRL2 mode = 2), so it is not retried until the next power cycle.
